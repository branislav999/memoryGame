# Overview

As a software engineer aiming to strengthen my programming skills in various languages. Through this project, I seek to reinforce my understanding of fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript which I am interested in learning more about and hopefully master harder concepts.

The software consists of a command-line interface where users can choose from various options, including logging in, changing passwords, generating random passwords, and adding new credentials.

This project is a memory game, which enables the user to reveal cards, and match the pairs of emojis. The game has four pairs.

There are two purposes in creating this software. I wish to master the basic programming concepts by implementing real-world functionality in JavaScript. And also, I intend to enhance my understanding of DOM and how to manipulate a web page using JavaScript. Through this project, I strive to build confidence in my abilities to apply fundamentals of programming.
